## What are your primary goals as a human being?

- Help people.

## What do you want  us to know about your communication style?

- I often enjoy reading and working async. 

## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?

- I really enjoy digging in and actually using / reproducing anything technical to make sure I have a thorough understanding.
- I work best in small groups and with people I know. I also work best when the task/project is clearly defined and the overall goal is explained.

## How can you best work with me?

- Be transparent, and honest. If I'm making a mistake, let me know. 
- I like having things written down.

## What are your pet peeves?

- Rude people.
- People that don't think they can learn any additional information/not willing to listen.

## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?

- I like making sure I understand things, so I may ask questions that seem redundant.
- If I don't start something right away, oftentimes I find myself postponing things.
